        25 points with a 27 point cap.&nbsp; Note, the 1st game of the
        7pm match should start at 7pm, therefore warm-ups should take
        place before 7pm if possible within the constraints of the
        Discovery Center rental usage.&nbsp; If, however, time becomes
        short, the games will be abbreviated to 19 points with a 21
        point cap.&nbsp; The start of the match is defined as the end of
        the previous match or 7pm, if it is the 1st match of the
        night.&nbsp; Time is defined as becoming short if the 1st game
        ends later than 25 minutes past the start of the match (20
        minutes for the 7pm match).&nbsp; If the cumulative time at the
        end of the 2nd game is longer than 40 minutes from the start of
        the match, than the 3rd game will also be shortened.&nbsp; <br>

            arranged.&nbsp; <b>ALL playoff substitutes must be approved
              unanimously by the remaining captains prior to 5pm on the
              day of a playoff match.</b>&nbsp; If any substitute player
            is from a team that is still in the playoffs, that player
            MUST rejoin his/her team immediately when their match is
            ready to start.&nbsp; The team for which he/she was subbing
            may NOT request an exceptional sub (see below) to replace
            him/her; they will be required to continue their match with
            the remaining players or forfeit if fewer than 5 players
            remain.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">Opposing captains are
            encouraged to support teams needing subs during playoffs but
            can object to a substitute for ANY reason.&nbsp; As
            practical guidance, substitute players from lower divisions
            are nearly always approved; substitute players from the same
            division can be considered but might not be approved.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">If a player is injured during a
            playoff match and cannot play further, and if that would
            cause the team to forfeit the remainder of the match, the
            captain may seek an exceptional sub.&nbsp; That substitute
            player must be approved by all captains currently at the
            facility AND the division commissioner.<br>

        points with a 27 point cap. If a third, deciding game is

        the playoffs, captains will be required to provide work teams
        for certain matches in which their team will not be
        participating. Work teams will be assigned based on a schedule
        drawn up by the league commissioner.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">A work team consists of 4 players:
          one to keep score, two to call lines and a 2nd (or down)
          referee.&nbsp; All teams in the league will be required to
          provide a 2nd (or down) referee except the lowest level
          division.&nbsp; The lowest level division will only be
          required to provide a work team of 3 players.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Teams failing to provide a work
          team for the assigned matches will be penalized 3 points per
          missing player at the start of their work match in
          corresponding games of the work team's next match. In other
          words, if a work team does not show up for an assigned match,
          9 points would be awarded to the opposing team at the start of
          each game of the match. It is the team's responsibility to be
          aware of when they are the assigned work team for a
          match.&nbsp; There is no grace period for the work team.&nbsp;
          A team of 8 players should be able to have 3 persons present
          for the beginning of their work match (including 7pm starts).</font>
