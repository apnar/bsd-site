My step-daughter's volleyball coach had suggested I might actually be good at volleyball. I guess she has noticed my "skills" while I was helping my step-daughter's team warm-up/practice. If I had to categorize my skill level, I'd generally say it's either BB, BBB, or AB. I've never done drills or practices, only played for fun.|6'1"|If possible, I'd like the opportunity for an "open mic night" like event to just show what actual skills I have. I honestly don't think I'm a beginner beginner, overall. Perhaps someone else can judge my skill level. City of Gaithersburg did say that y'all might have something like that, something about a draft league or open gym night ... I don't know. I'd love for someone to reach out to me to get me more information.|City of Gaithersburg suggested I get in touch with y'all. I reached out to the City to find out about being a free agent, since I don't have a team myself. I just want to get some exercise (in the form of sports), possibly meet some new people (though I'm pretty quiet), etc. My step-daughter playing volleyball and introducing me to the anime Haikyu, kinda inspired me to look into it.||

I played on a competitive high school team that made the AAA state playoffs. In college I was not on a formal team but played frequently with friends who were all former high school players and knew what they were doing. ~~Since the beginning of the covid pandemic I have played mostly grass doubles, where last summer I was competing in tournaments at an AA or A level depending on the size of the tournament. I recently graduated from Penn State before moving to the area and my senior year I served as the president as the Outdoor Volleyball Club, so I played frequently through that. ~~I know strategy, rules, and everything like that so I would not call myself a gym class or picnic player. Based on the descriptions and videos provided on the experience page I believe I would belong at the AA level and certainly not lower than A. I am an opposite/outside hitter so my setting is not very good but hitting, blocking, defense, and serving are all at a level that matches the AA description given.|6'02"||Facebook MD/DC/VA volleyball group||

My setting is generally weak (it's gotten better), but I can do it in a pinch. I do not know the setting numbers really well and would need a refresher if playing with hitters who call for them.

I've played with a variety of skill levels as it is rec, but since I've been playing for a while now i crave a more competitive gameplay with players who have the understanding of the flow of creating attacks and defending attacks, and usually try to find players who can do that to play with. I understand the basics of offense, how to make a good pass, basic setting, and the timing for various attacks with practice, I've successfully executed blocking and am currently focusing the timing for a block and can consistently serve, i also love to play defensively when i am in the back line, watching the ball movement carefully to get a dig up to my best ability. I play at a minimum once or twice a week and I believe i have the ability to play in AB or higher. I love the game and I am really excited to bring whatever I can to the table and give it my all!! My consistency in digging up harder hits to make a good pass and hitting against blocks its what i really want to work on with a team!|5'7|I will only be able to make the first tryout and I will miss the other two because I will be out of town. I will also miss the first seasons game on the 22nd of june and the final playoff game on the 17th of aug. I communicated with dee via email and he stated to state this in the registration form and i could still get picked up, Thanks!|Players i met while playing pickup!||

I typically play 5-1 w/double blocking consistently for approximately a year, have a good sense of positions, and have can reasonably bump, set, and hit, but am less consistent with digging, diving, and rolling. With setting, I usually just hand-set and can back set, but this back set is day-to-day. With hitting, I can sufficiently hit to wherever my body is facing, but can have trouble hitting to particularly zones that aren't a cross shot. ~~~  ~~~ From the descriptions, I would say that I'm somewhere between A and AB just because I'm not sure what would be defined as hard, consistent or solid defensively (ex: I'm not bouncing the ball even on an open net, but am still hitting it at a decent hitting level). Although, from the videos, I'd say I'm anywhere from AA to A.|6' 0"|Very willing to help out in any way I can! Just let me know what is available :)|Current player (James M)||hitter/setter//|

I am fatter than I once was, but believe I have good defense for the BSD A level and the ability to play above the net.  I'm more of filler on an A roster and not a big hitter or server.  I'd be super interested in playing as a setter, but am much worse at setter than any other position and my setting is not currently suitable for the A division.  If I was allowed to pick exactly what position and division I played in I would make myself a full-time setter in AB this season.|5' 9"||The Llerenas||hitter//passer/|My wife Norys Garcia-Villatoro. ~~~ 301-318-4075|hehim||///////////||
