    <h1>Referee Expectations</h1>
  </center>
  <hr>
  <p>The Bump Set Drink (BSD) Volleyball league strives to provide referees
  that are knowledgable, impartial, and conscientious.&nbsp; The experience
  pool for BSD Volleyball referees ranges from those that maintain professional
  certifications to former USAV players to dedicated league members who have
  received informal training within the league.&nbsp; All BSD Volleyball
  referees are expected to follow these expectations.<br></p>

  <p><u>Expectation 1</u>: <b>Remain professional and objective at all
  times.</b>&nbsp; Do not let players antagonize you and do not retaliate for
  any such attempts.&nbsp; Remain calm at all times and use the following
  choices of penalties as necessary and appropriate to control players: verbal
  warnings, yellow cards (awards point to opposing team), player ejections (red
  card), and player disqualifications (yellow &amp; red card).&nbsp; All yellow
  and red cards should be reported to the League Officials at the end of the
  match.&nbsp; League Officials will meet to determine more severe sanctions,
  if necessary.<br></p>

  <p><u>Expectation 2</u>: <b>Learn the rules.</b> Referees are expected
  to learn the current BSD rules located on the BSD website.&nbsp;<br></p>

  <p>It is impossible for one referee to see everything.&nbsp; Here are tips
  and guidance to help you excel on the stand:<br></p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Play Format:</b>
    There will be a 6 minute warm-up period before the start of each match.
    Warm-ups for the 7:00pm match should take place before 7pm if possible.
    Please prepare as much as possible before the previous match ends.  Please
    see the <b><i>"Match Times and Game Lengths"</i></b> section of BSD's official rules for
    details on play format.<br><br></li>

    <li><b>Before the Match:</b>
    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
      <ul>
        <li>Arrive 10 minutes prior to the match, bring the captains together,
        perform the coin toss (winning captain picks choice of serve/receive or
        side).</li>
        <li>If you like, you can also perform a second coin toss for third
        game; the winning captain can wait to choose serve/receive or
        side.</li>
        <li>Give 6 minutes warm up time.</li>
        <li>While teams warm up, make sure that the benches and score table are
        within the out of bounds lines between the courts and that there are no
        chairs, tables or player belongings, between the 10 foot line and the
        net on each side.</li>
        <li>On the scoresheet, record your name for referee, enter the team
        names, and record the planned start time.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <br><br>

    <li><b>Player Behavior:</b> The captains should be warned during the coin
    toss that improper behavior will not be tolerated.&nbsp; League officials
    will review all player ejection and disqualifications and may impose
    further sanctions, including suspension from the league (usually based on
    multiple infractions or a particularly severe infraction).&nbsp; There will
    be no special circumstances for anyone.&nbsp; If a team does not have
    enough players to continue after an ejection or disqualification, they will
    forfeit.<br><br></li>

    <li><b>Forfeits:</b> For each match of the evening, a grace period of 10
    minutes after the <u>scheduled match start time</u> will be allowed before
    the first game will be forfeited.&nbsp; Each subsequent game of the match
    will be forfeited every 5 minutes afterward.&nbsp; Play will start as soon
    as each team has at least 5 players (with the required minimum number of men
    &amp; women).&nbsp; The score of each forfeited game will be recorded as
    25-0.&nbsp; If a team forfeits, the games may still be played; the score,
    however, will still be recorded as stated above.&nbsp; The referees may
    choose not to officiate a forfeited game.&nbsp; It is the league officials
    view that a forfeit should be avoided as much as reasonably possible.&nbsp;
    If anyone is available to substitute, all attempts should be made to play
    the match as scheduled.<br><br></li>

    <li><b>At the Start of Each Serve:</b></li>
    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
      <ul>
        <li>Look for server foot faults.</li>
        <li>Check player locations on each team (on the court and in rotation).</li>
        <li>For two players to be considered out of rotation, one player must have
        a foot clearly beyond both feet of the adjacent player.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><b>During Play:</b></li>
    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
      <ul>
        <li>Administer time outs, 2 per team per game.</li>
        <li>Look for improper/illegal contacts: 4 team hits, multiple hits, held ball</li>
        <li>Unless otherwise stated, all USAV rules should be
        followed for calling illegal contacts.&nbsp; Since calling hand sets
        can be challenging and contentious, we will clarify the two 
        forms of illegal contact:</li>
        <li style="list-style: none">
          <ul>
            <li><i>Multiple Hits</i> &ndash; these are allowed on a team's
            1<sup>st</sup> contact if only one attempt is made to play the ball.
            &nbsp;Multiple hits are never allowed on a team's
            2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> contact.&nbsp; These should be
            called uniformly across all leagues.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><i>Held Ball</i> &ndash; the ball is contacted for too long of a
            time (also called "carry" or "lift" by many people).&nbsp; This
            applies to <u>all</u> contacts: passes, hand sets, hits, dinks,
            etc.&nbsp; Before the match begins, you should choose how long you
            will allow for length of contact and enforce that consistently for
            every contact throughout the match.&nbsp; BSD typically allows
            longer contacts in the lower leagues and shorter contacts in the
            higher leagues, to allow the lower league players more opportunity
            to develop their skills.&nbsp; One way to be consistent about your
            held ball calls is to repeat a specific word in your head with each
            contact and, if you believe any contact goes longer than the word,
            whistle and signal a held ball.&nbsp; You can choose shorter,
            quicker words for higher leagues and longer, slower words for lower
            leagues.<br></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Finally, some general points about calling illegal contacts:</li>
        <li style="list-style: none">
          <ul>
            <li><b>Above all, be consistent.</b>&nbsp; Strive to enforce the
            same standards on both teams throughout the match.</li>
            <li><b>Only call illegal contacts that you <u>SEE</u>.</b></li>
            <li>The best way to make illegal contact calls is to anticipate who
            will next play the ball and zoom your focus in on that person,
            watching the contact as closely as you can.</li>
            <li>A ball spinning as it comes out of a hand set is <u>not</u>
            necessarily an illegal contact (multiple hit or held ball).&nbsp;
            It <i>might</i> be a sign that you need to watch the contact more
            closely.</li>
            <li>Realize that you won't always have the best angle to see all
            contacts, which means sometimes you will miss calling an illegal
            contact.&nbsp; If you players become especially vocal in
            criticizing missed calls, you can let the team captains know that
            you will start giving verbal warnings to those players to improve
            their conduct.</li>
            <li>Referees should not lower their standards because a particular
            player is struggling to play within the rules.&nbsp; It is the team
            captain's responsibility to make adjustments for any player not
            performing well.</li>
            <br><br>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
   <li><b>End of Games:</b> At end of each game, direct the teams to switch
   sides and then write down the scores and end time.&nbsp; At the end of the
   third game, if you are not scheduled to ref but the next ref is not yet
   there, do the pre-match stuff (call the next match's captains over for the
   coin toss, etc) so that the next match's warmup proceeds right away.<br>
