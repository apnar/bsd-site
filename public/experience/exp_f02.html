<h1>
Player Experience - Fall 2002</h1></center>

<hr>
<br>Once again, there appear to be some themes developing...
<p><b>Unbridled Enthusiasm:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>"Played for many years. Got tired of the commute. Wife (Sujee) is playing
there, might as well keep her company."</b> - Dave Haskins.</li>

<br><i>Now that's enthusiasm!!!&nbsp; Read it again, but think about the
voice of Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh...</i>
<li>
<b>"I caused h*ll to freeze over last season!" </b>- Andrea Stump.</li>

<br><i>Yes... Andrea was drafted into AA last season.&nbsp; However, the
Commissioner's Curse is still alive!</i>
<li>
<b>"Coed naked doubles..." </b>- Brian Siever.</li>

<br><i>Umm... I am going to skip tryouts this year...</i>
<li>
<b>"An American Idol (not!)"</b> - Frank Willard.</li>

<br><i>As Simon would say, "Do you have a volleyball coach?&nbsp; Sue him
for malpractice!!!"</i>
<li>
<b>"I had my head spiked into a volleyball net once."</b> - Dave Russin.</li>

<br><i>That's sad.&nbsp; Sideout and cost your team a point once again...</i></ul>
<b>Kids (this league is getting OLD!):</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>"Named my son "Tachikara SV-5W Gold"</b> - Micah Hoffman.</li>

<br><i>Tachikara Hoffman.&nbsp; Nice.&nbsp; Rolls off the tongue...</i>
<li>
<b>"I have given birth to 13lbs. worth of a doubles volleyball team!&nbsp;
And guess what.....they both suck too!"</b> - Kyra Wohlford.</li>

<br><i>That's impressive.&nbsp; 13lbs. of sucking.&nbsp; Two suckers, no
waiting... is there anything left of Kyra?</i>
<li>
<b>"I can't back it up, but I believe my father's first girlfriend had
an illegitimate child with Sinjin Smith."</b> - Kevin Hightower.</li>

<br><i>Mmm... the pickup games at the Hightower family reunions must have
been something.&nbsp; Bet the volleyball was pretty good too!!!</i></ul>
<b>Webmaster Abuse:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>"Still recovering from therapy sessions due to Webmaster's failure to
post Spring 2002 Players' Experiences."</b> - Oscar Mulford.</li>

<br><i>Interesting.&nbsp; Mosy people think the Webmaster needs therapy
after reading these things.</i>
<li>
<b>"I don't know why I bother to put anything here anymore.&nbsp; The damn
webmaster thinks he has better things to do than amuse me by putting this
on the web page." </b>- Dan Leeds.</li>

<br><i>Yes, the Webmaster took the season off to amuse only himself.</i></ul>
<b>Shameless Self-Promotion:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>"<a href="http://www.bumpsetdrink.com/hall.html" target="new">Link to
Joe's Experience</a>"</b> - Joe Potts.</li>

<br><i>Nice.&nbsp; Try this: <a href="http://www.despair.com/pretension.html" target="new">Link
to Joe's Resume</a>.</i>
<li>
<b>"How about we let Joe pick all of the teams?" </b>- Jack Griffith.</li>

<br><i>Refer to the Spring 2002 experience comments for context.</i>
<li>
<b>"The Kay Leaman Factor!"</b> - Kay Leaman.</li>

<br><i>This is one of the more interesting streaks in the league.&nbsp;
What do the A-division champions in the Fall of <a href="../hall/fall96a.html">1996</a>,
<a href="../hall/f97a.html">1997</a>,
<a href="../hall/fall98a.html">1998</a>,
<a href="../hall/fall99a.html">1999</a>,
<a href="../hall/fall00a.html">2000</a>,
and <a href="../hall/fall01a.html">2001</a> have in common?&nbsp; The Kay
Leaman factor!&nbsp; The A-division captains have known about this for
many seasons, but Kay has never mentioned it... until now.&nbsp; Of course,
now that she brought it up... the streak ended in the Fall of 2002.</i></ul>
