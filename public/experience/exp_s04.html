Player Experience - Spring 2004</h1></center>

<hr>
<br>Hey, we have some new categories this time.&nbsp; Let's start with
one of my very favorite...
<p><b><u>Butler Bashing!</u></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>"My dream to become the Joe Potts of A league was dishearteningly shattered
in the last game of the last match of the playoffs by the evil Darth Gillick!!!"</b>
-- Steve Butler</li>

<br><i>Interesting comparison.&nbsp; Steve does yell, roar, carry on, complain
about every call, bawl-out teammates, turn red, gyrate, agitate and put
on quite a show during his hour on the court each week.&nbsp; Who does
that sound like?&nbsp; I think we can safely call Steve Butler the "Joe
Potts of A league"... except without the winning thing!&nbsp; (Glad I could
help restore order to the galaxy last season!)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Butler yelled at me. I yelled back. We dueled with pistols at dawn.
I shot him in the head. He shot me in the buttocks. I think it was a draw
(so to speak). Then, on a dark and stormy night, I was visited by the ghost
of Christmas future and he showed me a world where there was no Butler
and I was sad. So I pledged not to burn down his house nor steal his can
of Red Bull. The volleyball world rejoiced and it was good." </b>-- Ron
Thompson</li>

<br><i>I had to really think about this one.&nbsp; A world without Butler...
what would that be like?&nbsp; A world where women were once again valued
on the volleyball court and men could play freely without threat of being
called a shanking-*&amp;^%%#.&nbsp; Hmm... enticing as this may sound,
I will join with Ronnie-T and say this would be sad.&nbsp; You see, I beleive
that for good to really shine through there must be a clear evil present.&nbsp;
Mr. Butler does serve a purpose after all :-)</i></ul>
<b><u>Not the Family Section:</u></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>"Want to play with Michael Smith."</b> -- Dao Smith</li>

<br><i>I presume that is why you married him.&nbsp; Now what does this
have to do with volleyball?</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"I left my knees at the Corner Kick." </b>-- Paul Finver</li>

<br><i>My knees don't miss "The Kick", but my liver misses it badly!!!</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Well, there was this one time at Band Camp…uh, that wasn't volleyball.&nbsp;
Sorry."</b>&nbsp; -- Micah Hoffman</li>

<br><i>OK!&nbsp; Since Micah went there... here's the unedited quote: <a href="flute.wav">Band
Camp</a>.&nbsp; Ahh... what the heck, here's some more: <a href="bitch.wav">Say
My Name</a>, <a href="used.wav">Used</a>, <a href="18yrs.wav">Stiffler's
Mom</a></i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Almost completed many 12 step programs.&nbsp; Still performs own stunts.&nbsp;
Floatation devices at sea have become pointless, as I have developed a
stone-like body density.&nbsp; Teammates should start wearing something
lucky." </b>-- John Gartner</li>

<br><i>Another reason why the Webmaster is also a team captain.&nbsp; It
keeps me off Gartner's team :-)</i></ul>
<b><u>Stage Fright:</u></b>
<br><i>These folks all seem to have tried to come up with something witty...
but couldn't step up to the plate at the key moment.&nbsp; Is this a Levitra
moment?</i>
<ul>
<li>
<b>"My brain hurts too much to come up with something witty.&nbsp; Maybe
I should start using my hands to block instead of my face."</b> -- Paul
Dethlefsen</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"I just can't think of anything funny at the moment.&nbsp; I guess I
really should plan ahead for filling out the form." </b>-- Dan Leeds</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Sorry, can't think of anything snappy this time." </b>-- Llerena Isabel</li>
</ul>
<i>Sad, very sad.&nbsp; Let this be a lesson to you all for next season.&nbsp;
The Webmaster cannot make chicken salad out of chicken poop :-)</i>
<p><b><u>Misc:</u></b>
<blockquote>
<li>
<b>"Experienced at baking for my team and stressing about whether my players
will show."</b> -- Christina Wu</li>

<br><i>Ooooh!!! Draft me!!!&nbsp; I you're baking before games, I promise
I will show up early :-)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Esbo&ccedil;ando me a sua equipe traduz &agrave; vit&oacute;ria! Segundo
lugar em BB dois anos em uma fileira. (courtesy of babelfish.altavista.com)"
</b>--
Fred Robinson</li>

<br><i>Hmm... something about not being equipped to lead his team to victory!&nbsp;
Second place in BB two years in a row.&nbsp; Translated to Portuguese.&nbsp;
Ay carumba!</i></blockquote>
