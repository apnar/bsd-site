<h1>
Player Experience - Fall 1998</h1></center>

<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<b>"I watch Gabrielle Reece play every chance I get."</b> -- Dan Leeds.</li>

<br><i>I do too... and it has nothing to do with volleyball.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Didn't shank a pass in Spring 98 season."</b> -- Frank Webert.</li>

<br><i>True... Frank sat out the entire season with a broken finger.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"C league but advancing. Will not play with Joe Potts."</b> -- Bob Weiss.</li>

<br><i>This is my favorite because he needlessly goes out of his way to
take a shot at someone. Risky move though... I'm sure Joe talked him down
at the AA drafts.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Hit 3 triples and 4 doubles this past season" </b>-- Dee Coplon.</li>

<br><i>Cool, my team could use a designated hitter.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"No experience as a volleyball."</b> -- Joe Potts.</li>

<br><i>That's good... since I've seen how Joe treats a volleyball!</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"That which is most needed, but never acquired until after it is desperately
needed."</b> -- Scott Ichniowski.</li>

<br><i>Scott apparently has a philosophical explanation for his troubled
game. Well, you can't have everything... where would you put it?</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Undefeated in AA match play."</b> -- John Gartner.</li>

<br><i>True... And John is at no risk of ruining this perfectly symmetrical
record again this season.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"I am Super G, 'nuff said"</b> -- Gabe Chang.</li>

<br><i>Umm... normally I would ignore this shameless cry for attention,
but I thought of a better way to handle this. Isn't "Super G" that discount
label produced by Giant Foods? So, isn't Gabe saying that he's a cheap
imitation of the real thing? 'Nuff said.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Buncha clinics, a few tourneys, works and plays well with others (is
that better, you guys?)" </b>-- Nathan Chidester.</li>

<br><i>Yes Nathan, much better. Thanks for asking. (see last season's abuse
for context).</i></ul>
