Ever wonder what happens when you consume copious amounts of alcohol
while coming off 3 days worth of cold medication?&nbsp; Well... read on
'cuz that's what the Webmaster is working on as he responds to the Fall
2004 Experience gems...<br>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;In
the sequel, "Revenge of the Sith", this time the evil Darth Gillick
resorted to abducting 3 of my warriors so that I would have to enter
the battle undermanned. &nbsp;We felt confident that we could still
prevail, until we underestimated the power of his new apprentice, the
sneakily evil Darth Woolley.&nbsp; To fulfill the prophecy of bringing
balance to the force, my goal next session is to steer the young
impressionable Woolley away from the dark side.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
    <br style="font-weight: bold;">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> In other developments, a new form
of evil has arisen embodied in the bounty hunter Ronnie T. Fett.&nbsp;
Although he is currently weak in power and has yet to prove a threat to
all that is good, his growing power will be closely monitored.&#8221;</span>
&#8211; Steve Butler<br style="">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">These
are extremely precient comments by Mr. Butler.&nbsp; He wrote this
before he knew he would be able to draft Matt Woolley from the
Webmaster's team the previous season to own this season.&nbsp; And
about the incident with Ronnie T. later in the playoffs... it was all
foreshadowed I guess.&nbsp; Unfortunately for Mr. Butler, the Webmaster
completed his trilogy of t-shirts.&nbsp; Like Darth Vader said to
Luke,"Who's your daddy!"&nbsp; :-)</span><br style="">
