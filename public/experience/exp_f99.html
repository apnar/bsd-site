Player Experience - Fall 1999</h1></center>

<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<b>"BumpSetDrink describes my game perfectly, except for that bump and
set part."</b> -- John Gartner.</li>

<br><i>Um... there's nothing I can add here.&nbsp; That pretty much sums
it up!!!</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Am willing to drink, but only if necessary."</b> -- Dan Wingerd.</li>

<br><i>Heh, heh.&nbsp; It seems to be necessary about once a week for Mr.
Wingerd...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"I would have more experience if the commissioners wouldn't kick us
off the courts at midnight"</b> -- John Gillick.</li>

<br><i>Sure, blame someone else for my troubled game...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"8 T-shirts and a bag to carry them in."</b> -- Joe Potts.</li>

<br><i>The league had to vary it's prizes to accomodate the humble Mr.
Potts...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Have gotten real close to winning BB.&nbsp; Even played on the last
night of playoffs for 2 years."</b> -- Phil Dennis.</li>

<br><i>Hmm... it doesn't quite have the boastfulness of Mr. Potts' comments,
but I guess you have to start somewhere.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"I had 37 kills in a single game in a dream I had last year."</b> --
Dan Leeds.</li>

<br><i>That's funny, I had I dream where I blocked Dan 37 times... definately
must have been a dream :-)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"None under new name."</b> -- Achie Mah.</li>

<br><i>Hmm... I wonder if I would make AA league if I changed my name.&nbsp;
As long as I didn't have to marry Ray...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"On occasion, I spike the ball VERY hard!"</b> -- Billy Milligan.</li>

<br><i>Yes, those "occasions" only came up every time we set him!!!</i>.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"As tall as Michelle Akers, with a better swing (and more intense...)"</b>
-- Betsy Gillick.</li>

<br><i>She's understating the intensity thing.&nbsp; The Webmaster's house
is not a happy place when we lose..</i>
<br><i>.</i>
<li>
<b>"IBM/Loral/LM BB, B, C, D, E and F Leagues (Okay, just kidding about
the F-league part)" </b>-- Scott Ichniowski.</li>

<br><i>Yeah, well... only 'cuz we didn't have an F-league :-)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"It was Skip."</b> -- Dee Weiss.&nbsp; <b>"It was not Matt."</b> --
Bob Weiss.</li>

<br><i>The debate continues...&nbsp; I didn't see it.&nbsp; I did hear
the load boom of a well-struck volleyball slamming into an unsuspecting
victim.&nbsp; I also heard the audible grimaces of about 15 men who were
watching the play.&nbsp; And, I turned around to see Joe Potts on all fours
clutching his groin area in obvious pain.&nbsp; Then, Joe got up to argue
with the ref about some call (was Joe called for a double hit, perhaps?)
and then return to the ground after losing the argument.&nbsp; I don't
know who it was... but if I were Matt or Skip, I'd consider wearing a cup
(just in case).</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"I'll play with anybody except Scott Ichniowski.&nbsp; If he drafts
me, I'm moving to San Francisco."</b> -- Peter Hsu.</li>

<br><i>Wow, I guess Scott should have known better.&nbsp; Hey Peter, how's
the sourdough?</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Will buy beer (repeatedly)"</b> -- Elizabeth McFarland.</li>

<br><i>Okay, Elizabeth didn't really write this.&nbsp; Dale wrote these
comments on my scouting sheet at the A tryouts.&nbsp; I really tried to
draft her too... but Doug must have been offered more.&nbsp; Damn.&nbsp;
Anyway, this is the kind of shameless bribery that really impresses the
captains.&nbsp; Forget that volleyball stuff...</i></ul>
