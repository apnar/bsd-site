<h1>
Player Experience - Spring 2003</h1></center>

<hr>
<br>While this season's offerings seem to lack in quantity... uh... well...
they lack in quality too.&nbsp; Nevermind!
<ul>
<li>
<b>"I am a very experienced "older" player."</b> -- Ken Alperin</li>

<br><i>Which explains why Ken's mug shot can be found in elder care facilities
all over the state.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"I'm 5'4" with a 1" vertical for a grand total 5'5" of volleyball blocking
fury at the net!!!"</b> -- Paul Dethlefsen</li>

<br><i>I'm not sure what he would be furiously blocking at that height,
but from now on I'm wearing a cup if Paul is across the net...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Hothead, major headcase, unbearable, you know the type -- perfect for
your team!" </b>-- Jack Griffith</li>

<br><i>Somebody has been hanging out with Mr. Potts far too long...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Too cheap for golf."</b> -- Gary Steele</li>

<br><i>Cinderella story... Big hitter the Lama... DOOTIE!!!... There like
the Vietcong - varmintcong... It's in the hole!!!...</i>
<br><i>Here's more: <a href="c_cannonball.wav">#1</a>... <a href="c_sucks.wav">#2</a>...
<a href="c_worsthat.wav">#3</a>...
<a href="c_barkdog.wav">#4</a>...
<a href="c_laid.wav">#5</a>... (whoa, major segue... what were we talking
about?)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Bride's maid the last 3 seasons.&nbsp; Which is ok, because white really
isn't my color.&nbsp; But those frilly garter's really make my legs look
sexy."</b> -- John Gartner</li>

<br><i>I just know, before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of
serious therapy.&nbsp; Look at my eye twitchin'...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"A perennial member of John Gartner's (losing) teams."</b> -- Isabel
Llerena</li>

<br><i>Heh heh... I like that summary :-)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"I once shook hands with Joe Potts!"</b> -- Rick Toth</li>

<br><i>Eww... I hope you washed your hands...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Thursday Nights: Many growlers: Tried the Bass Ale, Dominion Lager,
Killian's and Yuengling.&nbsp; Friday Mornings:&nbsp; Bass Ale; Queasiness
with persistent headache. Hangover Richter Scale: 4.5,&nbsp; Killian's;
Major headache with lingering inebriation. Hangover Richter Scale: 7.0,&nbsp;
Dominion Lager; Beer-flavored Kool-Aid. Ugh! Hangover Richter Scale: 6.5,
Yuengling; Ahhhh; Now that hits the spot. Hangover Richter Scale: 0.0.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Oh yes; There is the small matter of an undefeated season in A and the
miraculous three-match night to come from the Loser's Bracket and win the
championship."</b> -- Ron Thompson</li>

<br><i>This is the kind of hard work and sacrifice you must endure if you
want to win a championship!!!</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Was a AAAAAA player in a previous lifetime (sometime around 48 B.C.).
I was also a toll booth operator in one lifetime too, so it may not be
too credible." </b>-- Kevin Hightower</li>

<br><i>I hope it wasn't the same lifetime... unless you are a Flintstones
character...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"UC, IMHO, WYSIWYG! U'LL C @ THE T/O'S. &amp; L8R IF U R ROTFLOL, SO
B IT! THX 4 LOOKING ;-) OH, BTW FYI >10YRS INCL 3 BB &amp; 3 B. NEXT A?"</b>
-- Fred Robinson</li>

<br><i>Wow.&nbsp; Push back from the keyboard and slowly walk away...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Colorado Springs - Olympic Volleyball Exhibition Team - I watched,
THEY don't suck!"</b> -- Kyra Wohlford</li>

<br><i>Again with the "sucking" references.&nbsp; These pages have more
sucking references than the Starr report...</i></ul>
