<h1>
Player Experience - Spring 2001</h1></center>

<hr>
<p>Over the course of the season and offseason, many folks have asked me
"What happened to that juvenile thing you do with the experience thingys?"&nbsp;
Well... here's the story:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Last spring I had compiled all of your witty comments on my laptop at
work and was just about ready to post it to the website when a funny thing
happened - my dog ate it!!!&nbsp; Okay, okay... the real excuse is not
quite that lame.&nbsp; Turns out that SpaceWorks, Inc. (my employer at
the time) decided to go bankrupt one afternoon and the confiscated my laptop
as a company asset.&nbsp; (Yeah... the dog story would have been better.)
<p>So, that's the deal.&nbsp; All of your clever work was for naught (kinda
like the efforts of my fellow SpaceWorks co-workers, but there I go again...)&nbsp;
Anyway, if somebody has a record of the experience comments for Spring
2001, please send it to me.
