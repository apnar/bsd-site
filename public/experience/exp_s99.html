Player Experience - Spring 1999</h1></center>

<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<b>"In an attempt to improve my "pounding" of the ball, I successfully
gained significant weight in the off-season."</b> -- John Gartner.</li>

<br><i>John's success in this "weighty" matter has been amply noted and
we will have the paramedics standing by just in case.&nbsp; Perhaps next
time he could just work on his eye-hand coordination.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Driving thunder, spikes like hail; sets so accurate, so high, so sweet;
passing as swift, aloft as a gale; defensive specialist, Super G, never
beat." -- </b>Gabe Chang.</li>

<br><i>Hmm... do you think Gabe was counting on an audience for this one?&nbsp;
Shameless...again.&nbsp; Okay Mr. Poet, try this one: "His mouth spews
thunder, but with spikes so frail, his teammates wonder why he can't play
like a male."</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"My outdoor ball was featured in a volleyball magazine advertisement."</b>
-- Dee Weiss.</li>

<br><i>Remember the Service Line magazine that MAV used to publish?&nbsp;
It contained an advertisement that featured a brown, dried-up, leather-peeling,
hideous shell of a volleyball with the caption "Time for a new ball?".&nbsp;
Apparently, that ball belonged to Dee.&nbsp; (I wish I had a copy to scan
in.&nbsp; It was amusing.)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"MAV CK BB/B, "Team PinkyPoo"..."</b> -- Walter Gruendl.</li>

<br><i>Team PinkyPoo?&nbsp; And you're proud of this name?&nbsp; No...
I'm sorry... it's off to C-league for you!!!</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"IBM/LM BB, Chinese 9 man pickup..."</b> -- Raymond Mah.</li>

<br><i>Chinese 9 man pickup?&nbsp; Hmm... I assume we're still talking
about volleyball here. (sorry... it had to be done.)</i>
<br><i>Actually, if he's used to playing nine to a side, then sixes should
seem like wide open spaces for him.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"None, but I can spell Scott's last name w/o help." </b>-- Jonathan
Peiffer.</li>

<br><i>Heh, heh.&nbsp; Then you can qualify for Webmaster.&nbsp; I took
me a long time to get used to spelling Ichniowski twice a week.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Was married to a volleyball for 3 yrs.&nbsp; Currently seeing a soccer
ball."</b> -- David Russin.</li>

<br><i>Seriously, David, I'm a little concerned about your choice of inflatable
friends...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Sturn un drang (We went "2 and out" as No. 1 seed last fall)." </b>--
Rodney Smith.</li>

<br><i>Whoa... that sent the Webmaster scrambling.&nbsp; I believe you're
going for the German "Sturm und drang" which translates literally to "Storm
and Stress", or (very) loosely to "Crash and Burn".&nbsp; And, yes, you
did :-)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Played once.&nbsp; No big deal."</b> -- Mike Staley.</li>

<br><i>Mike's AA buddies agree.&nbsp; They've seen him play...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Have taken several photographs of Karch Kiraly."</b> -- Frank Willard.</li>

<br><i>In fact, Frank submited a picture with his application.&nbsp; It
was Frank's head super-imposed on Karch Kiraly's body.&nbsp; Very scary.</i>
<br>&nbsp;</ul>
Here's an intersting theme.&nbsp; These folks are obviously trying to grab
some captain's attention.&nbsp; I guess it worked.&nbsp; They're 3 for
3.&nbsp; Well, kind of...
<ul>
<li>
<b>"Too experienced for BB.&nbsp; Early enough for the discount.&nbsp;
Getting new shoes."</b> -- Gary Steele.</li>

<br><i>I like this one.&nbsp; A combination of arrogance, practicality,
and useless information.&nbsp; OK... you made A league.&nbsp; Gotta be
'da shoes!!!</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"(CENSORED).&nbsp; Would love to move up to A."</b> -- Peter Schiff.</li>

<br><i>The censored part is where Peter discusses draft information from
last season's BB draft.&nbsp; That's a no-no, but apparently he was forgiven
this time.&nbsp; I expect he'll put down his A division draft ranking next
time, right? :-)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Several seasons in C League.&nbsp; Its about time I got out."</b> --
Denise Richmond.</li>

<br><i>OK Denise... you got out!!!&nbsp; We cancelled C league, just for
you. :-)</i>
<br>&nbsp;</ul>
Lastly, some folks have asked to see what the Webmaster puts down for experience.&nbsp;
Here's two for the price of one:
<ul>
<li>
<b>"Volleyball.&nbsp; It's not just a game, it's an obsession."</b> --
John Gillick</li>

<br><i>Insert your own smart-alecky comment here...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"I tolerate my husband.&nbsp; He needs serious attention."
</b>-- Betsy
Gillick.</li>

<br><i>I wonder what Mrs. Webmaster is trying to say here...</i></ul>
