<h1>
Player Experience - Spring 2002</h1></center>

<hr>
<p>There appear to be a number of themes developing among player's responses
to the "Experience:" question.&nbsp; It's been a long time since we last
did this... so let's dive right into the controversial ones, shall we?
<ul>
<li>
<b>"My wife is making me do it, maybe I will see her more often."</b> -
Paul Dethlefsen.</li>

<br><i>Most men have to beg for it... Paul's wife MAKES him do it.</i>
<li>
<b>"My husband bought me a new v-ball because mine was worn out."</b> -
Theresa Dethlefsen.</li>

<br><i>I'm confused.&nbsp; If it's worn out, then why make him do it more
often?</i>
<li>
<b>"I'm an old ball handler from way-back!"</b> - David Russin.</li>

<br><i>Which is why David is banned from over 30 assisted living facilities
in Montgomery County alone...</i>
<li>
<b>"Invented volleyball in 1895, first spike in 1916, this will be my 107th
season." </b>- Kevin Hightower.<br>
<i>This is true.&nbsp; I verified it back in 1970 when Al Gore invented
the Internet.&nbsp; I was the first Webmaster!!!</i></li>

<li>
<b>"98% of my friends play volleyball"</b> - Dan Leeds.</li>

<br><i>Really?&nbsp; Which league? (heh heh)</i>
<li>
<b>"Not exactly." </b>- Frank Willard.</li>

<br><i>Reminds me of that car rental commercial.&nbsp; "There's Hertz and
there's "Not exactly". " I guess Frank would be "Not exactly" :)</i></ul>
Here's a new theme (not): AA trash talking...
<ul>
<li>
<b>"Not a good drafter - must have been luck (12 times)."</b> - Joe Potts.<br>
<i>The humble Mr. Potts drops the gauntlet...</i></li>

<li>
<b>"I draft better than Joe!"</b> - Jack Griffith.<br>
<i>OK. Jack did draft the winning team this year... but Joe was not a captain.&nbsp;
Does that count?</i></li>

<li>
<b>"4 league wins over 5 years followed by 8 years of the Commissioner's
Curse (enough already!)" </b>- Andrea Stump.<br>
<i>Our League Commissioner is either recalling glory days so far gone that
they are not documented on the website... or she is making it up entirely
:)&nbsp; As for the Commissioner's Curse, the Webmaster was happy to keep
it alive the last 3 seasons :)</i></li>

<li>
<b>"I watch 'AA' a lot.&nbsp; Learning how to be arrogant."</b> - Ron Alger.</li>

<br><i>WOW.&nbsp; It's nice that our friends in AA are willing to share
their skills :)</i></ul>
Predictably, a few comments recalled the closing of the Corner Kick...
<ul>
<li>
<b>"New playing venue will provide a multitude of excuses for erratic play.&nbsp;
Will draft for Potts."</b> - John Gartner.</li>

<li>
<b>"No experience playing volleyball without the aid of cold beer and cheese
fries."</b> - John Gillick.</li>

<li>
<b>"I only play well on dimly lighted courts with green, half-rotted, beer-stained
turf."</b> - Oscar Mulford.</li>

<li>
<b>"I can drink a pitcher of beer and still hit the ball."</b> - Thomas
Wynne.<br>
<i>Umm... not anymore :(</i></li>
</ul>
The inspirational catch-phrase from last season that propelled the B champions
to carry a banner that reads "The Champions Suck!" continues, despite the
fact that Kyra Wohlford took this season off to make more volleyball players...
<ul>
<li>
<b>"We won Kyra a shirt so she'd quit.&nbsp; She sucks!"</b> - Tim Sechler.</li>

<li>
<b>"Kyra still sucks!"</b> - Amy Huber.</li>
</ul>
Yes, it's a simple rule.&nbsp; Anytime somebody uses foul language to belittle
another, I will print it :)&nbsp; But sometimes, the refreshingly honest
approach needs to heard...
<ul>
<li>
<b>"I want to learn how to play &amp; don't know how to at all!&nbsp; I'm
bad!"</b> - Linda Nguyen.</li>

<br><i>That pretty much sums it up.&nbsp; At least you can figure there
shouldn't be an ego problem with her :)</i></ul>
