Player Experience - Fall 2000</h1></center>

<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font size=-1>"</font>Was voted least likely to trip while walking by
a group of my peers."</b> - Dan Leeds.</li>

<br><i>As long as chewing gum was not involved...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Confident that I will be last one left at the end of the season...
unless Gillick starts walking around naked, then f*** it I'm outta here"</b>
- John Gartner.</li>

<br><i>A "Survivor" reference and a slam at the Webmaster.&nbsp; No worries,
I would be prohibited from nudity anyways... no large weapons allowed on
the island :-)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>“One t-shirt can't be wrong!!”</b> – Dee Weiss.</li>

<br><i>See Joe Potts' comment from Spring 1998... Dee's crowing about her
one season winning streak :-)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
&nbsp;<b>“Wow, is this the same Bob Weiss who won BB and played AA all
in the same season?”</b> – Bob Weiss.</li>

<br><i>Was this on your wife's AA team perhaps?</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"After the 'bump-set' part, I can - sometimes - keep up with the rest
of the league."</b> - Peter Stegehuis.</li>

<br><i>The first step is identifying the problem.&nbsp; Now you need to
log those hours in the bar to improve :-)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Yes, before and after the bar." </b>- Paul Finver.</li>

<br><i>Volleyball before or after the bar, I sure can't tell the difference
in his game :-)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Perennial last round pick in B-level"</b> - Tim Sechler.</li>

<br><i>C'mon now.&nbsp; The last round picks are reserved for newcomers
with experience comments like "none" or "spastic".</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Last one that I can remember was good."</b> - Ken Alperin.</li>

<br><i>You can still remember?&nbsp; You haven't been married long enough...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Have played more hours of pickup than actual league play."
</b>- Oscar
Mulford.</li>

<br><i>Yeah... most of my best plays have come during pickup.&nbsp; Both
of them...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"A white man who can jump (some)" </b>- Lane Hala.</li>

<br><i>Jumping is overated.&nbsp; It's ducking that's important...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Worshipped as a Volleyball God in a Small (Very, VERY Small) 3rd World
Country."</b> - Scott Ichniowski.</li>

<br><i>Hey... this is true!!!&nbsp; It took months of research, but I did
find evidence of Scott's claim.&nbsp; A small tribe in the South Pacific
worships Scott!!!&nbsp; <a href="scott_idol.jpg">See for yourself...</a></i>
<br><i>Very, VERY Small... look carefully :-)</i>
<br><i>(Could the Webmaster be any more juvenile?&nbsp; No, I don't think
so...)</i></ul>
