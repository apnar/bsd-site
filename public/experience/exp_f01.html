Player Experience - Fall 2001</h1></center>

<hr>
<p>It's back!!!&nbsp; Now with flavor crystals.&nbsp; I normally save the
best for last, but this time I'm leading off with the two comments that
made me laugh out loud.&nbsp; Here we go...
<ul>
<li>
<b>"<u>Kyra sucks.</u>&nbsp; Same team as&nbsp; (blah, blah, blah)." </b>-
Amy Huber</li>

<br><b>"(boring details.) <u>Kyra sucks</u>. Same team as (blah, blah,
blah)."</b> - Tim Sechler
<br><i>Excellent!!!&nbsp; I had no idea what this was all about until I
received an email from Tim Sechler requesting that Kyra Wohlford's name
be officially changed on the B roster (which I did).&nbsp; Since then,
I have received numerous emails telling me what a mean-spirited and nasty
Webmaster I am for posting "Kyra sucks" on the website.&nbsp; OK, I am
mean-spirited and nasty... but that has nothing to do with this example.&nbsp;
Here... read for yourself.&nbsp; Tim's email is heart-warming and inspirational:</i>
<p><i>"One match last season, during a time-out, Kyra seemed to be taking
the fact that we were way behind much more to heart than usual.&nbsp; When
we broke the huddle instead of yelling "Let's go" or "De-fense" or what
ever else you might choose to yell to fire your team up we broke with "Kyra
Sucks!"&nbsp; That broke the tension, got her laughing, and our team actually
played better after that time-out, and cameback and won a game which at
one point we were seriously behind.&nbsp; After that "Kyra Sucks" became
our rallying cry."</i>
<p><i>Brings a tear to my eye :-)&nbsp; I now have a favorite team in B
division.&nbsp; I presume they are carrying on the tradition this season,
since Tim, Amy, and Kyra are back together again.&nbsp; Hey, next time
my team gets down 10 points or so... we'll go with the "Kyra sucks" chant
too.&nbsp; As long as it works!!!</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"I have watched it on TV &amp; I saw Castaway."</b> - Michael Pence.</li>

<br><i>Now I know why Mike talks to the ball between points.&nbsp; Now
I am very afraid.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Often watch the Maryland volleyball team."</b> - Frank Webert.</li>

<br><i>Hmm... are they any good?&nbsp; Can they beat Duke?&nbsp; Fear the
Turtle!!!&nbsp; (heh heh, that kills me...)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"After birth, how hard can a volleyball be?" - </b>Dee Weiss.</li>

<br><i>Well, the ball is kind of soft... but much larger around than your
baby at the time of birth.&nbsp; I can't believe I'm going there...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"My husband obsesses about volleyball.&nbsp; Does that count?" </b>-
Connie Gartner.</li>

<br><i>Yes, it does.&nbsp; But this year HE'S GOING DOWN!!!&nbsp; Hard.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"15 years as League Director (many with Dale, of course) -- does that
count as experience?" -</b> Andrea Stump.</li>

<br><i>Yes, that counts as experience.&nbsp; It's an experience most of
us can appreciate, but do not envy.&nbsp; And then there is the "Commissioner's
Curse"...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"I am the weakest link."</b> - John Gillick.</li>

<br><b>"Goodbye!"</b> - Betsy Gillick.
<br><i>OK, the Survivor Rules didn't fly last season.&nbsp; How about "Weakest
Link Volleyball"?&nbsp; Hmm...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Ankle is still a bit tender after the surgery.&nbsp; The Asteatosis
is just a small matter.&nbsp; I'm sure the Somnoplasy surgery will go well.&nbsp;
And the Gastroesophageal Reflux disease should stay in remission till after
play-offs.&nbsp; Definitely a 8th round selection this season." </b>- John
Gartner.</li>

<br><i>Nice attempt at sandbagging... but we all would appreciate it if
you got that chronic flatulence taken care of :-)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"OK, not enough - if I had enough experience we would not have [needed
to] come from the losers bracket to win it all!" - </b>Chris Thomas.</li>

<br><i>Yes... all shameless references to past glory will be posted.&nbsp;
Especially when the player happens to be referring to the Webmaster's team
too.&nbsp; (And by the way Chris, we all did blame you for losing that
one early playoff match.)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Used to have it a lot, then it got rusty, then I lost it, now I want
to get it back." - </b>Gabe Chang.</li>

<br><i>They sell little blue pills to fix that now.&nbsp; And when you
get it back... maybe you shouldn't play with it so much anymore.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Joe Potts' team last season.&nbsp; What other experience do I need?"
</b>- Dan Leeds.</li>

<br><i>None.&nbsp; A 29-1 record and the championship is very impressive.&nbsp;
Now, about Joe Potts' team this year...</i>
<br><i>*** <u>Webmaster's Update</u>: At the time I wrote this, Mr. Potts'
team was dead in the water.&nbsp; They were going down like dogs.&nbsp;
However, somebody recently mentioned that I should update this comment
after Team Potts recovered and won in the playoffs.&nbsp; Gee... who could
have made that request, hmm?</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"I can spell volleybawl." - </b>Evan Glickstein.</li>

<br><i>About as well as you play it.&nbsp; (j/k)&nbsp; See... there I am
being mean spirited and nasty again.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Lots"</b> - 3 people.</li>

<br><b>"None"</b> - 8 honest people.
<br><b>"Yes"</b> - 6 people.
<br><i>And you all probably thought you were being original :-)</i></ul>
