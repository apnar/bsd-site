Player Experience - Fall 2003</h1></center>

<hr>
<br><b>The Webmaster's vast reservoir of creative prose has dried up.&nbsp;
After months of working for something funny... I've got nothing!!!&nbsp;
So, for this season, I have contracted out my responses (to the lowest
bidder, naturally).</b>
<p><b><u>Pop Culture</u></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>"After months of specialized training with Sensei Miyagi I was able
to learn the intricate "crane" kick and defeat Johnny Lawrence (you know,
the evil leader of the Cobra's) in the All Valley Karate Tournament.&nbsp;
I have since moved on to other interests such as volleyball.&nbsp; I am
currently attempting to master such moves as "swat the fly", "carry the
baby" and "throw the pizza" to complement my karate moves "<a href="wax.wav">wax
on, wax off</a>" and "paint the fence".&nbsp; I am confident this experience
will add a rich variety to your league and enhance the competitive spirit."

Ron Thompson</li>

<br><i><b>Mr. Miyagi</b>: [sighs] Ronnie-T-san, must talk. Man walk on
road. Walk left side, safe. Walk right side, safe. Walk down middle, sooner
or later, get squished [makes squish gesture] just like grape. Same here.
You volleyball do "yes," or volleyball do "no." You volleyball do "guess
so," [makes squish gesture] just like grape. Understand?</i>
