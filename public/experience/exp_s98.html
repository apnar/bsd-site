Player Experience - Spring 1998</h1></center>

<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<b>"Played against Sinjin Smith at the beach"</b> -- Dee Coplon.</li>

<br><i>It was funnier before I found out it was true.&nbsp; Really... I
heard she did.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Nothing glib to offer this year!"</b> -- Joe Potts</li>

<br><i>Last season, Joe wrote "6 out of 7 T-shirts can't be wrong".&nbsp;
Joe did not add to his collection last season.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Baldwin and I got some crappy prize for winning Dee's Doubles League."</b>
-- John Warner</li>

<br><i>My wife wants to know if John won the BB division :-)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"A and BB... B when I play with Dale!"</b> -- Roy Melton</li>

<br><i>Is this a sandbagging reference?&nbsp; Or is he saying Dale brings
down his level of play?</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"17 1/2 years of IBM/LMCO/LM Volleyball BB." </b>-- Kathy Dehn.</li>

<br><i>Wow.&nbsp; I didn't know the league was around that long.&nbsp;
I especially like the inclusion of that half-year.&nbsp; Yeah, 17 years
wouldn't be quite impressive enough...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"160 hours (+-20) since the start of the Fall 1993 season"</b> -- Scott
F. Ichniowski</li>

<br><i>Does this league draw from engineering companies or what?</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"A little"</b> -- Frank Willard</li>

<br><i>Frank plays in the AA division, proving "a little" can go a long
way...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Spring 86 IBM C League"</b> - Frank Webert</li>

<br><i>He played C league 12 years ago... that's helpful to know.&nbsp;
Frank failed to mention some A division experience more recently.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Finally, the ever popular... <b>"Yes"</b> -- Nathan Chidester</li>

<br><i>Cute Nathan, but you can do better than that...</i></ul>
