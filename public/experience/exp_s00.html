Player Experience - Spring 2000</h1></center>

<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<b>“Yeah, baby!”</b> – Bill Epstein.</li>

<br><i>Oh, behave!!!</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
&nbsp;<b>“Too Much!”</b> – Bill Grennon.</li>

<br><i>You can never have too much.&nbsp; Are we talking about volleyball?</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"I can't PASS, SET, SERVE, SPIKE, DINK, BLOCK, DIG, COVER... - AA Wanna
Be." </b>– Sandy Bilodeau.</li>

<br><i>Gee, with that as a reference I have no idea why she slipped to
BB :-)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Experience as digger and setter"</b> – Dianne Butler.</li>

<br><i>I like this one.&nbsp; No experience as a hitter?&nbsp; Does your
team ask you to leave the court after 2 hits?</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Able to leap tall Monopoly™ buildings in a single bound (usually)"</b>
– Scott Ichniowski.</li>

<br><i>But, come playoff time it’s: “Do not pass go, do not collect $200”.
(heh heh, couldn’t resist)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"I was that guy who played with Val Kilmer against Tom Cruise in that
movie Top Gun.&nbsp; Yeah, that's the ticket!"&nbsp;</b> -- David Russin.</li>

<br><i>But, you LOST!!!&nbsp; LOSER!!!&nbsp; (heh heh, it's fun to be the
webmaster sometimes...)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>“I kick one around every once in a while.”</b> – Dan Leeds.</li>

<br><i>All that kicking probably explains why most of his hits wind up
in the soccer goal :-)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Will someone please retire from A-league?!&nbsp; Thanks, BB-for-life."
</b>– Oscar Mulford.</li>

<br><i>Wow.&nbsp; This shameless appeal actually worked.&nbsp; Next year
I'll write this...&nbsp; “Will 32 people please retire from AA and maybe
63 people retire from A?&nbsp; WooHoo – I could be The Man then!!!&nbsp;
(OK, maybe not)”</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Last played Fall 1999.&nbsp; I have not touched a volleyball since
then in an effort to forget bad habits."</b> – Frank Webert.</li>

<br><i>Hmm... I’m not sure what bad habits he’s referring to.&nbsp; But,
if he’s not touching his ball, then I’m not touching his ball either.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Runner-up in my last competition, which was fine 'cause I entered it
on a dare, and I didn't want to marry Rick Rockwell anyway..."
</b>– John
Gartner.</li>

<br><i>You know, I was wondering what that was during the swimsuit competition.&nbsp;
I thought my wife had switched the channel to “Free Willy”.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"Tried a volleyball once, now very happy with my husband."</b> – Dee
Weiss.</li>

<br><i>OK, this one got me thinking bad things.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, it’s Bob’s
response that had me falling out of my chair laughing...</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>"So I've got that going for me."</b> – Bob Weiss.</li>

<br><i>Heh heh... (Bill Murray from "Caddyshack", right?)</i></ul>
