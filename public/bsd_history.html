<h2><small><font face="Arial">Where we started</font></small></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">How in the world did we
end up
with a volleyball league
named Bump Set Drink?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s quite a story
and has been a long and exciting ride.<br>
<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><br>
The Bump Set Drink Volleyball League started life as the IBM
Company Volleyball League.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>IBM was (and
still is) a large employer in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Montgomery
County</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">MD.</st1:state></st1:place><span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Back before 1994, IBM had large sites in
several <st1:state w:st="on">Maryland</st1:state> locations &#8211; <st1:city
 w:st="on">Gaithersburg</st1:city>,
<st1:city w:st="on">Rockville</st1:city>, and <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Bethesda</st1:place></st1:city> being the largest &#8211; as well
as other
sites throughout the Washington Metropolitan Area (WMA).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>IBM ran many company sports leagues through
their Watson Trophy program, including the volleyball league based out
of the
Corner Kick Pub and Sports Facility in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city
 w:st="on">Gaithersburg</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">MD.</st1:state></st1:place><span
 style="">&nbsp; </span></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">The policy of the IBM
Company
leagues was fair play for all
&#8211; all players played all games on a rotational basis to ensure equal
time for
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyone who wanted to play was able
to do so, as the league offered all skill levels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Teams
were drafted each season from a draft pool
of registered players, starting with the highest leagues and continuing
until
all players were selected for a team.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The league was available to IBM employees and their spouses (and
a few
older children).</font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">By the late 1980&#8217;s, the
league
was offering 5 levels of
play:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A, B, C, D, and E.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These levels ranged from highly skilled (A)
to beginner (E).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In most (if not all)
seasons, the league was fully engaged, with 8 teams in each of the 5
divisions
(for 40 teams, 320 players).</font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">The league was run by
the IBM
Club, with a league director
named each season to manage the drafts and league details.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Several current members of Bump Set Drink
Volleyball did stints as league directors in those days.</font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">The award for winning an
IBM
company league was called the
&#8220;Watson Trophy&#8221; and was presented at a dinner party known as the Watson
Trophy
Banquet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Watson Trophies weren&#8217;t
trophies &#8211; they ranged from jackets to gym bags to blankets and were
much
coveted by members of the IBM community.</font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<h2><small><font face="Arial">The Venue</font></small></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">How to best describe the
Corner
Kick?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the playing field, picture a
large
Quonset hut with dividing 3-foot walls (with netting from the walls to
the
ceiling) creating two indoor soccer fields.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now divide each soccer field into two volleyball courts using a
floor to ceiling netting across the middle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cover
it all with worn out Astroturf laid
directly over hard concrete and you are about there!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was definitely different from anything
else you&#8217;ve ever seen&#8230;and for those of us who spent many hours there,
quite the
memory!</font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Looking down on the
playing
field from the second floor was
an English Pub with one wall consisting almost entirely of plexiglass
windows,
to best afford the view of the fields.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The bar offered beer, wine, wine coolers, and food (who can ever
forget
the toasties, loaded cheese fries, wings, and Southwestern Ranch
Chicken subs?).</font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<h2><small><font face="Arial">The Day It All Changed</font></small></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">In late 1993, IBM
announced its
plan to sell its Federal
Systems Division to the Loral Corporation in early 1994.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This effectively split the IBM Company league
down the middle &#8211; approximately half the members would remain with IBM,
the
rest would be sold to Loral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
anticipation that neither company would continue to support a joint
league, two
active league members (Dale Kawamura and Andrea Stump, who were going
to be
with IBM and Loral, respectively) started negotiating with Mid-Atlantic
Volleyball (the most active area volleyball association) to sponsor a
new,
independent league formed from the IBM Company league.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Negotiations were successful and the league
continued seamlessly, with Dale as League Director and Andrea as his
assistant,
under the new label of &#8220;IBM/Loral League&#8221;. </font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">This continued until
early
1996, when Loral made the
decision to sell the bulk of its business to the Lockheed Martin
Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By now, the league
directors were old hands at this, so the league continued without pause
under
the title &#8220;IBM/LM League&#8221;.</font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<h2><small><font face="Arial">The Contest for a New Name</font></small></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">In the late 90&#8217;s, the
decision
was made to drop the IBM and
LM references in the league title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
the league was not sponsored in any way by either company, it was felt
that the
league deserved its own name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A contest
was held for a new name &#8211; and the winning name combined the volleyball
(bump,
set) with the social aspects of a league held in a venue with a bar
overlooking
the courts (drink), melding the concepts well.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Kudos to continuing league member Bill Epstein for winning
bragging
rights on the league name (as well as some pez and pocket lint!).</font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<h2><small><font face="Arial">Changing of the Guard</font></small></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">During the Fall 1999
season,
Dale Kawamura decided to retire
as the League Director for BSD Volleyball and focus on coaching his
kids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Andrea Stump took over as league
director.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quickly realizing this was a
lot of work for one person, she soon partnered with Dee Weiss to form
the team
that still runs the league today.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Together with a fantastic set of division commissioners (who
have
changed some over the years and who have all done great work), the
league
continues to run smoothly today.</font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<h2><small><font face="Arial">The Corner Kick Closes</font></small></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">The next big change for
the BSD
league was the sudden
closure of the Corner Kick in January 2002.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In 2001, the building housing the Corner Kick was sold to
Fitzgerald
Auto Mall (whose showroom is located about a mile from the Kick), who
started
using the back parking lot as a storage area for unsold vehicles.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Many were suspicious that this was the
writing on the wall (having new unsold cars in the parking lot of a bar
doesn&#8217;t
sound like the greatest idea), but things continue at the status quo
for a
while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the ball dropped &#8211; during
preparations for the Spring 2002 season, the league directors were
notified of
the immediate closure of the Corner Kick.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was a sad day for all who called the Corner Kick home many
nights of
the week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As one of the league directors
played in the last game (soccer, in this case) ever played at the
Corner Kick,
it hit very close to home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, with
the flexible spirit of the BSD league, the league directors quickly
negotiated
with the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Discovery</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype w:st="on">Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> on the
grounds of
the Maryland Soccerplex to rent Thursday night court space, so the
Spring 2002
season started on schedule.</font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Just for the record,
Fitzgerald
Auto Mall still calls the
building housing their parts supply warehouse &#8220;The Corner Kick&#8221;.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<h2><small><font face="Arial">Bump, Set, Drink, Inc. is formed</font></small></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">In late 2006,
Mid-Atlantic
Volleyball and the league
directors of BSD held discussions resulting in the decision to part
ways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:personname w:st="on">MAV</st1:personname>
had sponsored BSD for more than 10 years, saving the league when the
companies
split, and for that we are very grateful.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Long-time members of the
BSD
league knew that the league was
too good to let die, so the decision was made to form a company and run
as an
independent league.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus was formed the
Bump, Set, Drink, Inc. corporation, with board members Andrea Stump
(President), Dee Weiss (VP, Secretary, Treasurer), John Gillick, Jack
Griffith,
Steve Truland, and Bob Weiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With two
seasons under their belts (as of this writing), the league has
continued
seamlessly and continues to thrive.</font></small></p>
<h2><small><font face="Arial">In closing, what are we all about? </font></small></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p></font></small></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">The prime goal of the
Bump Set
Drink Volleyball League is to
provide a social and enjoyable volleyball experience for players of all
skill levels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We continue to use the draft
system established by IBM to ensure league parity and also a new and
different
experience for players each season.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
league also continues to use the rotational lineup system that allows
all
players to play every game in an equal and fair manner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No player is preferred, none is forgotten.</font></small></p>
