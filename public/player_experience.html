  <p class="MsoBodyText">This page was developed for new players to assist you in
  rating your own experience level compared to the divisions in the Bump Set Drink (BSD) Volleyball
  league.  The videos below were taken from actual BSD playoff games at each level of play.  If you
  are unsure which level you should be playing, please check out the videos and let us know which
  one best describes your game.  <strong>NOTE:</strong> These are <i>only</i> guides to the level of
  play that is <i>often</i> seen in each division.  Each season brings a different set of players
  which may change the consistency of play at each level -- sometimes for the better, sometimes not.
  <br></p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="underline">Comparison to other leagues</span>:
  BSD's AA division is not comparable to USAV AA (men's or women's).  BSD is a co-ed league played
  on a men's height net.  In the table below you will find a rough comparison of the typical level
  of play seen in BSD divisions to other leagues in the area.  Keep in mind that the level of play
  changes each season (see the paragraph above), so these comparisons are sometimes close and sometimes
  a bit off.</p>

  <p>All players new to the league should come to the first tryout... aim high!  It's better for
  everyone to get you placed in the division most appropriate for your skill level.<br></p>

        <td class="c6" valign="top">AA division play is characterized by bumping, setting
        and hitting on nearly every rally.  Hitters put the ball down hard and usually face double
        blocking.  Many setters are skilled enough to set forward or back and can usually place the ball
        in spots to match the hitter's approaches.<br></td>

        <span class="c7">characterized by bumping, setting and hitting on nearly every
        rally.  The better hitter can hit hard and put the ball down, usually against single
        blocking.  Setters can be hand setters or bump setters and are usually fairly accurate. 
        Rallies can tend to be longer since there are fewer rally ending kills than AA division. 
        Most players in this division are also solid defensively.</span></td>

		Sometimes there are great plays and sometimes execution slips up!  Many
		players in this division could play at the higher levels with a little
		more consistency in their game. </span></td>

        <td valign="top">BBB division players are clearly a step above beginning
        players.  Usually, the teams attempt to score by bumping, setting and spiking.  Players in
        this level have a good understanding of court positioning and possess sufficcient skills to
        build long, exciting rallies.<br></td>

        be players will some good volleyball experience in this league (which helps keep play
        going).  This is also the place where players begin learning the difference between
        competive (refereed) volleyball and company picnic "carry and throw" exhibitions.  This is
        the league to learn how to pass correctly, where to stand on the court, practice defense,
        setting and hitting.</td>
