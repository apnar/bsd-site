    <h1>Co-rec Play and Gender at BSD</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      At Bump, Set, Drink, we are committed to fostering an inclusive and
      diverse community within our recreational volleyball league.&nbsp; We believe
      in the power of sports to bring people together, and we are dedicated to
      ensuring that everyone feels welcome and respected, regardless of their
      background, gender identity, or gender expression.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Our Commitment to Diversity:</dt>
      <dd>We take diversity and inclusion seriously.&nbsp; Our goal is to create an
      environment where every participant, regardless of background, feels
      valued and embraced.&nbsp; We celebrate the unique perspectives and talents
      that each individual brings to their team.</dd>

      <dt>Addressing Gender Identity:</dt>
      <dd>Gender identity is a serious and important aspect of an individual's
      identity.&nbsp; We recognize and respect that people may identify outside of
      traditional gender norms.&nbsp; It is our firm belief that no one should be
      excluded or disadvantaged based on their gender identity or expression.</dd>

      <dt>Fair Play:</dt>
      <dd>We are committed to maintaining the integrity of our sports
      competitions.&nbsp; We emphasize that gender identity should not be exploited
      or manipulated for a competitive advantage.&nbsp; Fair play is at the core of
      our values, and we actively work to ensure that all participants compete
      on a level playing field.&nbsp; Volleyball is fun when all are included and
      play is competitive, and we seek to strike that balance.</dd>

      <dt>Open to Feedback:</dt>
      <dd>We understand that navigating the complexities of gender and
      inclusion can be challenging, especially in an open/co-rec sports league.&nbsp;
      We may not always get it right, but we are committed to learning and
      evolving.&nbsp; We welcome feedback from our participants, supporters, and the
      wider community.&nbsp; Your insights and experiences are valuable, and we are
      dedicated to continually improving our practices.</dd>

      <dt>Get Involved:</dt>
      <dd>We encourage everyone in our community to actively support our
      commitment to diversity and inclusion, and to a successful volleyball
      season each and every season.&nbsp; To this end, if you would like to get
      involved and help shape the direction of BSD, please reach out to any
      of the League Directors!
