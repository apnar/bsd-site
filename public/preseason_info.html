      <dt>PRESEASON WEEK 1</dt>
      <dd>Focused heavily on skills drills &amp; games for <u>NEW</u>
        players, in response to many captains who have requested more
        opportunity to see new players.&nbsp; This will be capped at 96
        players for the night.&nbsp; Returning players can request when
        registering to play also the first week but we anticipate not
        being able to accommodate many requests.&nbsp; Only players who
        are requested/notified should plan to attend.</dd>
      <dt>PRESEASON WEEK 2</dt>
      <dd>All games!&nbsp; Everyone plays!&nbsp; The preseason teams
        will be automatically drafted based on captain feedback from
        week 1 and last division played.&nbsp; Captains should stick
        around to observe when not playing.</dd>
      <dt>PRESEASON WEEK 3</dt>
      <dd>All games!&nbsp; Everyone plays!&nbsp; Captains will have
        selected players to move up and move down, preseason teams will
        be automatically drafted based on that feedback.&nbsp; Captains
        should stick around to observe when not playing.</dd>
      <dt>REMINDER</dt>
      <dd>For weeks 2 &amp; 3: (A) Each division will play a single
        match of 3 games, capped at 50 minutes; (B) no refs, keep your
        own scores.</dd>

    <p><b><big><u>SCHEDULE INFORMATION:</u>&nbsp;</big></b> <br>
      Preseason Team assignments are usually published to the website
      one or two days prior to the games (Tuesday or Wednesday).&nbsp;
      This is necessary because last-minute cancellations create havoc
      with the teams when published too early. </p>
    <p><br>
      <b><big><u>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</u> </big></b><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you know you will not be able to attend a preseason match,
        please notify us by email ASAP.&nbsp; This greatly helps our
        planning and will make for a better experience for those who
        attend.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Players on the Wait List will be assigned to Preseason
