          well run.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being a team captain in

            and effort you bring and getting to play at an appropriate

              do not recommend teams playing a 6-2 format or 5-1 format

              opportunities are given to the women in the front row for
              hitting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why do we say this?<span
                style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
              some teams in the past have played
              these formats and bias the sets to the male hitters on the
              front row,
              leaving
              the front-row women with very little chance to play and
              contribute.<span style=""> </span>You would <i style="">think</i>
              this wouldn’t need to be said explicitly, but yet it still
